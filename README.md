# Fizzbuzz

Coding exercice

## Specs

- For any integer multiple of 3 return 'Fizz'
- For any integer multiple of 5 return 'Buzz'
- For any integer multiple of 3 and 5 return 'Fizzbuzz'

- Any other integer returns it as a string

> Number 0 is considered as a special value not multiple of either 3 or 5 (or any other number as a matter of fact).

Implement a solution that takes an int and returns the correct string.

Even if these are fairly simple requirements, special attention should be given to readability, architectural principles and good practices.

## Going further

Given an array 0 to 100, provide a way to identify contiguous numbers that leads to the sequence Fizz then Buzz or Buzz then Fizz.
For instance, 5/6 or 9/10.
